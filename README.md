## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work
- Compare their performance using **time complexity**
- Strengthen understanding of **algorithmic concepts used in Discrete Mathematics**

Each sorting step is visualized using text-based bars in the console.

## 📊 Time Complexity Overview

| Algorithm        | Best Case     | Average Case | Worst Case   |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Bubble Sort      | O(n)         | O(n²)        | O(n²)        |
| Selection Sort   | O(n²)        | O(n²)        | O(n²)        |
| Insertion Sort   | O(n)         | O(n²)        | O(n²)        |
| Merge Sort       | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)   |
| Quick Sort       | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)   | O(n²)        |
